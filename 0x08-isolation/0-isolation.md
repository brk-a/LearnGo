# isolation
* the thrid property in ACID
    - Atomicity &rarr; all operations in a transaction either complete or the whole transaction fails
    - Concurrency &rarr; the state of the db must be valid after a transaction completes or fails; all constraints must be satisfied
    - Isolation &rarr; concurrent transactions must not affect each other
    - Durability &rarr; data written by a successful transaction must be stored in persistent storage
* idea is this: concurrent transactions must not affect each other
### how transactions may affect each other
#### read phenomena 
1. dirty read üí©
    * transaction reads data written by another concurrent, uncommmitted transaction
    * we do not know if the other transaction will, eventually, be committed or rolled back; we might end up using incorrect data in case of rollback
2. non-repeatable read ü§°
    * transaction reads the same row twice and sees different values because said row has been modified by another committed transaction
3. phantom read üëª
    * transaction re-executes a query to find rows that satisfy a condition and sees a diffrent set of rows because said rows have been modified by another committed transaction
    * non-repeatable read for multiple rows
4. serialisation anomaly ‚ùó
    * the result of a group of concurrent, committed transactions is impossible to achieve because there is no way to run the queries of said transactions in any order without overlapping
### how to solve the problem
#### standard isolation levels
* ANSI has four standard isolation levels
    - level 1: read, uncommitted transactions
    - level 2: read, committed transactions
    - level 3: repeatable read
    - level 4: serialisable
#### read uncommitted isolation level
* a transaction can see data written by uncommitted transactions; this is how/why dirty reads occur
#### read committed isolation level
* a transaction can see data written by committed transactions
* dirty reads are not possible
#### repeatable reads isolation level
* a read query always returns the same result no matter how many times it is executed
* the condition should hold even after other concurrent transactions commit changes that satisfy the query
#### serialisable isolation level
* achieves the same result when transactions are executed serially, in the same order, instead of concurrently
* there exists at least one way to order the concurrent transactions w/o overlap
### isolation levels and read phenomena
#### mySQL
* start a mySQL docker container

    ```bash
        docker exec -it mysql8 mysql -uroot -ppassword123 fnbank
    ```

* in the mySQL terminal, run the following

    ```mysql
        select @@trasaction_isolation;
        select @@global.trasaction_isolation;
        set session transaction isolation level read uncommitted;
    ```

* you can set the isolation level you want
* see code in [0-isolation.sh][def]
* notice that the second terminal/session sees the balance as KES 90.00 even though the transactions in the first session have not been committed; this is a *dirty read*
* we eliminate dirty reads by raising the isolation above *read uncommitted*
* notice that in the second session, the query to find `account 1`'s balance returns 90.00 before the transaction in the first session is committed and returns 80.00 KES after said transaction is committed; this is a *non-repeatable read*
* notice that in the second session, the query to find accounts whose balance is greater than 90.00 returns three rows before the transaction in the first session is committed and returns two after said transaction is committed; this is a *phantom read*
* we eliminate non-repeatable and phantom reads by raising the isolation level above *read committed*
* notice, from session 2's perspective, that the balance seems to be inconsistent/incorrect: 80 less 10 is 70, not 60. this *is* an inconsistency; session one subtracts 10 from 80: balance is 70. session 2 does not interfere with session 1's transaction but cannot read the updated value. session 2 subtracts 10 from 70: balance is 60. session 1 does not interfere with session 2's transaction  but cannot read the updated value.this is how MySQL implements read repeatable isolation
* notice, when we subtract 10 from account 1 after setting isolation level to *serialisable*, that the query blocks. the reason is, in *serialisable* isolation level, MySQL implicitly all plain `SELECT` queries to `SELECT FOR SHARE`. a transaction that holds a `SELECT FOR SHARE` only allows other transactions to **read**, not **update** or **delete** rows
* this locking mechanism  eliminates the inconsistency we saw during the transaction at the *read repeatable* level
* said lock, however, has a time-out duration; if the second transaction does not commit or roll back to release the lock w/i that duration,a *LOCK WAIT TIMEOUT* error is returned
* in this case, retry the first transaction
    - always implement a transaction retry strategy
